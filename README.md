# C++ Minimax Tic-Tac-Toe

## Introduction
This project was an assignment for a 4th year artificial intelligence course. We were tasked with using the Minimax algorithm to create an AI for Tic-Tac-Toe. We were asked to do this in C++ on top of a simple OpenGL rendering framework written by the TA.

## Code Overview
- Most of the game logic can be found within TicTacToeBoard.h/cpp
- Some of the input handling and other related logic can be found in main.cpp as we were given a simple GLFW framework to work within
- MinMaxTree.h/cpp and MinMaxNode.h/.cpp contain most of the logic dedicated to the actual Minimax algorithm

## How To Run
As this is the source code for the project, it can be compiled and run with an IDE like Visual Studio or through the command line.
